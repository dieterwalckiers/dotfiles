- to set desktop wallpaper: launch xfdesktop-settings, set a wallpaper. In my case it didn't persist. Launch xfdesktop from terminal. A new session will be launched. Close this session and reboot. New wallpaper then persisted in my case

- set background image on xfce4 terminal too, with high shading
