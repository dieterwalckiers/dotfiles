# Install obsidian

## obsidian

install obsidian and point it to vault on SynologyDrive/obsidian/kennis

## obsidian.desktop

create an obsidian.desktop to make the obsidian:// thing work
(see example in this dir)
I placed it under ~/.local/share/applications/obsidian.desktop
(troubleshooting in https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-linux-tips-tricks-solutions-to-common-problems/6291/8)
(icons dir I used is /usr/share/pixmaps)

# Install Yakitrak/obsidian-cli from its repo

If all goes well this should now work beautifully with the `jl` (myJournal.sh) command (see custom-scripts)

# Obsidian settings
- vim bindings
- daily notes: in dailynotes dir
